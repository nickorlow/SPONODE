# Spotify Queue Manager for iMessage & SMS

## Why?
Ever been on a road trip and want to let your friends add to the queue, but don't wanna pass your phone around?
Don't want to go through the complicated process of setting up a shared playlist?
Want to play music in a public venue easily?

This allows anyone to imessage you a link to a spotify song, and it will be automatically added to your queue!

## What's Supported?
MacOS and Android
- Tested on Android 9
- Tested on MacOS Mojave & Catalina
- Likely to work on other versions

## Why No iPhone Support?
Apple's restrictive ecosystem will not allow for apps to read notifs/messages.

## What about explicit songs?
SPONODE will let you set wether you want to allow explicit songs, and it can even be remotely toggeled with a password!
